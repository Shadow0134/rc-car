# 🚗 Meet our Mobile Pentesting Platform
_Inspired very subtly by Watch Dogs, because… of course it is_ 😌

## What’s under the hood?
- Raspberry Pi 5 — the brain (and occasional troublemaker)
- Pi Camera Module 3 — because hacking blind is inefficient
- External 4G Adapter — internet, but make it mobile
- gocryptfs Secure Storage — because even chaos needs encryption
- Arduino Pro Micro — DIY Rubber Ducky payload system (original ones weren’t available here… so we said “fine, I’ll do it myself” 😢)
- An RC Car — because walking is overrated

## Live feed magic ✨

> rpicam-vid → SSH → mpv

_Low latency, encrypted, no fancy web dashboards — just pure terminal energy._

## Connectivity pipeline 🌐

> Raspberry Pi ←→ Tailscale VPN ←→ Laptop

_No NAT pain. No port forwarding nightmares. Just works™._

You’ll also find our ultra-simple kill switch in the repo — because sometimes the smartest move is knowing when to shut everything down instantly.

This was prototype #1, built during finals season (surprisingly survived), and yes — we already have cooler, scarier ideas planned for what comes next 😈

Stay tuned.
